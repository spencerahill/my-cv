# My Curriculum Vitae
This repository houses the source code I use to generate my
Curriculum Vitae.  It uses LaTeX, defining a simple class `shillcv`
that handles most of the formatting etc.

If you're just looking for a rendered version of my CV, you can find
it [here](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~shill/cv.pdf).

Some of the layout and LaTeX commands were modified from [this NSF
biosketch](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/nsf-biosketch/xdmybvfqdmyr)
template.

Choices about what to include, in what order, and how to format it,
draw heavily on [*The Professor Is
In*](https://theprofessorisin.com/buy-the-book/), which I highly
recommend.  Comments at the top of the CV file summarize these
recommendations.

Feel free to use this as a template for your own CV --- although make
sure you replace the CV entries themselves with your own!
